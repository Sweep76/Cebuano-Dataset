# Parse Tree Visualization

This repository contains Python scripts for converting bracketed sentence structures into parse trees and visualizing those trees using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The scripts read sentences from an input file formatted with square brackets, transform them into a tree representation, and display the trees both textually and graphically.
